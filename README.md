### Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Rules:
1. The game has a large 3x3 grid, with each cell containing a smaller 3x3 grid.
2. Play on a small grid; your move determines the next grid your opponent must play on.
3. Win a small grid by getting 3 in a row, which marks that grid for you on the large grid.
4. Win the game by claiming 3 large grid cells in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
5. If a grid is full or already won, the next player can choose any grid.
6. The game ends when someone wins the large grid or no moves are left.
